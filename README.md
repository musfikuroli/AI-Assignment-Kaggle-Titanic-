**Titanic Survival Prediction**

**Project Description**
This project tackles the classic Kaggle challenge of predicting passenger survival on the ill-fated Titanic voyage. The goal is to develop machine learning models capable of determining which factors were most influential in determining who survived the disaster.

***Data**
The project uses the Titanic dataset commonly found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). This dataset includes features such as:
Passenger ID
Survival Status (0 = Deceased, 1 = Survived)
Passenger Class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
Sex
Age
Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard
Number of Parents/Children Aboard
Ticket Fare
Cabin
Port of Embarkation

**Methodology**
Data Exploration and Analysis (EDA): Examining distributions, identifying missing values, and visualizing relationships between features.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature encoding (e.g., one-hot encoding for categorical variables), and potential feature scaling.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features or interactions to enhance the predictive power of the models.
Model Selection and Training: Experimenting with algorithms like:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines
Potentially Neural Networks
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters for better performance.
Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) to gauge model effectiveness.

**Results**
Summarize your key findings and the best-performing model(s).
Share insights gained about the features most important to survival.

**Future Improvements**
Explore advanced feature engineering strategies.
Experiment with more sophisticated ensemble techniques or deep learning approaches.
Consider creating an interactive visualization of results.

**Collaboration**
